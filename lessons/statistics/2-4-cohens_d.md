[Think Stats Chapter 2 Exercise 4](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2003.html#toc24) (Cohen's d)

>> 
**Code:**

*Input*: firsts.totalwgt_lb.mean() - others.totalwgt_lb.mean()

*Output*: -0.12476118453549034

*Input*: CohenEffectSize(firsts.totalwgt_lb, others.totalwgt_lb)

*Output*: -0.088672927072602

Using the outputs above, the data shows the mean weight of first babies is 0.12 lb (or 1.92 oz) less than the mean weight of non-first babies. Next, looking at Cohen's effect size to quantify the difference, the difference in means is -0.09 standard deviations, which is a small difference. First babies have been slightly lighter than non-first babies, but the difference is not large enough to be of concern.

This contrasts somewhat with the pregnancy lengths, because typically one would think that a longer pregnancy results in a larger baby, but given that the difference in mean pregnancy lengths amounts to only 13 hours, the difference in mean baby weight is not consequential.
